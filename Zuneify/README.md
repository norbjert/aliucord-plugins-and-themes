# Zuneify - an Aliucord theme

The original can be found [here](https://github.com/snappyapple632/Zuneify)
I fixed a broken URL that caused the background to break on some (or all?) devices

I may also change a few colors around.

If you want to use this version of the Zuneify theme download the original and replace the updater url with:
